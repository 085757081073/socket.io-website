## Server

### Bug Fixes

* add timeout method to remote socket ([#4558](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/4558)) ([0c0eb00](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/0c0eb0016317218c2be3641e706cfaa9bea39a2d))
* **typings:** properly type emits with timeout ([f3ada7d](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/f3ada7d8ccc02eeced2b9b9ac8e4bc921eb630d2))


### Features

#### Promise-based acknowledgements

This commit adds some syntactic sugar around acknowledgements:

- `emitWithAck()`

```js
try {
  const responses = await io.timeout(1000).emitWithAck("some-event");
  console.log(responses); // one response per client
} catch (e) {
  // some clients did not acknowledge the event in the given delay
}

io.on("connection", async (socket) => {
    // without timeout
  const response = await socket.emitWithAck("hello", "world");

  // with a specific timeout
  try {
    const response = await socket.timeout(1000).emitWithAck("hello", "world");
  } catch (err) {
    // the client did not acknowledge the event in the given delay
  }
});
```

- `serverSideEmitWithAck()`

```js
try {
  const responses = await io.timeout(1000).serverSideEmitWithAck("some-event");
  console.log(responses); // one response per server (except itself)
} catch (e) {
  // some servers did not acknowledge the event in the given delay
}
```

#### Connection state recovery

This feature allows a client to reconnect after a temporary disconnection and restore its state:

- id
- rooms
- data
- missed packets

Usage:

```js
import { Server } from "socket.io";

const io = new Server({
  connectionStateRecovery: {
    // default values
    maxDisconnectionDuration: 2 * 60 * 1000,
    skipMiddlewares: true,
  },
});

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log(socket.recovered); // whether the state was recovered or not
});
```

Here's how it works:

- the server sends a session ID during the handshake (which is different from the current `id` attribute, which is public and can be freely shared)
- the server also includes an offset in each packet (added at the end of the data array, for backward compatibility)
- upon temporary disconnection, the server stores the client state for a given delay (implemented at the adapter level)
- upon reconnection, the client sends both the session ID and the last offset it has processed, and the server tries to restore the state

The in-memory adapter already supports this feature, and we will soon update the Postgres and MongoDB adapters. We will also create a new adapter based on [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/streams/), which will support this feature.

Added in [54d5ee0](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/54d5ee05a684371191e207b8089f09fc24eb5107).

#### Compatibility (for real) with Express middlewares

This feature implements middlewares at the Engine.IO level, because Socket.IO middlewares are meant for namespace authorization and are not executed during a classic HTTP request/response cycle.

Syntax:

```js
io.engine.use((req, res, next) => {
  // do something

  next();
});

// with express-session
import session from "express-session";

io.engine.use(session({
  secret: "keyboard cat",
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
  cookie: { secure: true }
}));

// with helmet
import helmet from "helmet";

io.engine.use(helmet());
```

A workaround was possible by using the allowRequest option and the "headers" event, but this feels way cleaner and works with upgrade requests too.

#### Error details in the disconnecting and disconnect events

The `disconnect` event will now contain additional details about the disconnection reason.

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.on("disconnect", (reason, description) => {
    console.log(description);
  });
});
```

#### Automatic removal of empty child namespaces

This commit adds a new option, "cleanupEmptyChildNamespaces". With this option enabled (disabled by default), when a socket disconnects from a dynamic namespace and if there are no other sockets connected to it then the namespace will be cleaned up and its adapter will be closed.

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";
import { Server } from "socket.io";

const httpServer = createServer();
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  cleanupEmptyChildNamespaces: true
});
```

Added in [5d9220b](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/5d9220b69adf73e086c27bbb63a4976b348f7c4c).

#### A new "addTrailingSlash" option

The trailing slash which was added by default can now be disabled:

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";
import { Server } from "socket.io";

const httpServer = createServer();
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  addTrailingSlash: false
});
```

In the example above, the clients can omit the trailing slash and use `/socket.io` instead of `/socket.io/`.

### Performance Improvements

* precompute the WebSocket frames when broadcasting ([da2b542](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/da2b54279749adc5279c9ac4742b01b36c01cff0))


### Dependencies

- [`engine.io@~6.4.0`](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/releases/tag/6.4.0) (https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/compare/6.2.1...6.4.0)
- [`ws@~8.11.0`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/8.11.0) (https://github.com/websockets/ws/compare/8.2.3...8.11.0)



## Client

### Bug Fixes

* **typings:** do not expose browser-specific types ([4d6d95e](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/4d6d95e0792efd43b78c760b055764fef02ebc9e))
* ensure manager.socket() returns an active socket ([b7dd891](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/b7dd891e890461d33a104ca9187d5cd30d6f76af))
* **typings:** properly type emits with timeout ([#1570](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/issues/1570)) ([33e4172](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/33e417258c9a5697e001163971ae87821e9c097f))


### Features

#### A new "addTrailingSlash" option

The trailing slash which was added by default can now be disabled:

```js
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("https://example.com", {
  addTrailingSlash: false
});
```

In the example above, the request URL will be `https://example.com/socket.io` instead of `https://example.com/socket.io/`.

Added in [21a6e12](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-client/commit/21a6e1219add92157c5442537d24fbe1129a50f5).

#### Promise-based acknowledgements

This commit adds some syntactic sugar around acknowledgements:

```js
// without timeout
const response = await socket.emitWithAck("hello", "world");

// with a specific timeout
try {
  const response = await socket.timeout(1000).emitWithAck("hello", "world");
} catch (err) {
  // the server did not acknowledge the event in the given delay
}
```

Note: environments that [do not support Promises](https://caniuse.com/promises) will need to add a polyfill in order to use this feature.

Added in [47b979d](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/47b979d57388e9b5e9a332f3f4a9873211f0d844).

#### Connection state recovery

This feature allows a client to reconnect after a temporary disconnection and restore its ID and receive any packets that was missed during the disconnection gap. It must be enabled on the server side.

A new boolean attribute named `recovered` is added on the `socket` object:

```js
socket.on("connect", () => {
  console.log(socket.recovered); // whether the recovery was successful
});
```

Added in [54d5ee0](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/54d5ee05a684371191e207b8089f09fc24eb5107) (server) and [b4e20c5](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/commit/b4e20c5c709b5e9cc03ee9b6bd1d576f4810a817) (client).

#### Retry mechanism

Two new options are available:

- `retries`: the maximum number of retries. Above the limit, the packet will be discarded.
- `ackTimeout`: the default timeout in milliseconds used when waiting for an acknowledgement (not to be mixed up with the already existing `timeout` option, which is used by the Manager during the connection)

```js
const socket = io({
  retries: 3,
  ackTimeout: 10000
});

// implicit ack
socket.emit("my-event");

// explicit ack
socket.emit("my-event", (err, val) => { /* ... */ });

// custom timeout (in that case the ackTimeout is optional)
socket.timeout(5000).emit("my-event", (err, val) => { /* ... */ });
```

In all examples above, "my-event" will be sent up to 4 times (1 + 3), until the server sends an acknowledgement.

Assigning a unique ID to each packet is the duty of the user, in order to allow deduplication on the server side.
